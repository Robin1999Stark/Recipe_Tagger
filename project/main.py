                        in a spicy garlic-infused olive oil, creating a mouthwatering base 
                        for the pasta. The dish is then elevated with a medley of vibrant 
                        vegetables and a creamy tomato sauce that perfectly balances the heat. 
                        Tossed with al dente linguine and garnished with fresh parsley and 
                        grated Parmesan, this dish is a celebration of both simplicity and 
                        sophistication. It's a quick and impressive recipe that will satisfy
