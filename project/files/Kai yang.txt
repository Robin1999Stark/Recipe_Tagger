Kai yang or gai yang (Thai: ไก่ย่าง, pronounced [kàj jâːŋ], lit. 'grilled chicken'), also known as kai ping or gai ping (Thai: ไก่ปิ้ง), or pīng kai (Lao: ປີ້ງໄກ່, [pîŋ kāj]), is a Lao dish originating in Laos, but it is now commonly eaten throughout the whole of Thailand. The dish is a standard staple of street markets and readily available at all times. Being a typical Laotian dish, it is often paired with green papaya salad and sticky rice (Thai/Isan: ข้าวเหนียว, pronounced [kʰâːw nǐa̯w]; Lao: ເຂົ້າໜຽວ or eaten with sticky rice in bamboo (khao lam in Lao). It is also eaten with raw vegetables, and often dipped in spicy sauces such as Laotian jaew bong.

In Thailand, there are also many famous Thai Muslim varieties of kai yang which are not of Lao origin at all, but more akin to the grilled chicken from Malaysia.
