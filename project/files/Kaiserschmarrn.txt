Kaiserschmarrn (German pronunciation: [ˈkaɪ̯zɐˌʃmaʁn]) or Kaiserschmarren (German: [ˈkaɪ̯zɐˌʃmaʁən]) (Emperor's Mess) is a lightly sweetened pancake that takes its name from the Austrian emperor (Kaiser) Franz Joseph I, who was fond of this fluffy shredded pancake. It is served as a dessert or as a light lunch alongside apple sauce and contains raisins or dried cranberries.

Kaiserschmarrn is a popular meal or dessert in Austria, Bavaria, and many parts of the former Austro-Hungarian empire, e.g. Hungary, Slovenia, Czech Republic and northern Croatia, which usually use the name as a loan word or translations of it. In Slovenia, it is called "cesarski praženec" or "šmorn". Its Hungarian name is "császármorzsa" or "smarni"; its Czech name is "(Císařský) trhanec" or "kajzršmorn". In Slovak it is named "Cisársky trhanec".
