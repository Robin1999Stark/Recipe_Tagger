Chelow kabab (Persian: چلوکباب čelow-kabāb [tʃelowkæˈbɒːb]) is an Iranian dish consisting of steamed rice (čelow) and one of the many varieties of Iranian kebab. It is considered the national dish of Iran, and was probably created by the time of the Qajar dynasty.

Chelow kebab is served with accompaniments such as butter, sumac powder, basil, onions, and grilled tomatoes. The traditional beverage accompanied with chelow kebab is doogh, an Iranian yogurt-based drink, sometimes made of carbonated water.

In the old bazaar tradition, the rice and accompaniments are served first, immediately followed by the kababs, which are threaded on skewers, as well as a piece of flat bread (typically lavash). A skewer is placed directly on the rice and while holding the kabab down on the rice with the bread, the skewer is quickly pulled out.
