Svíčková, or svíčková na smetaně (pronounced [ˈsviːt͡ʃkɔvaː na smɛ.ta.ɲɛ]), is a Czech meat dish and one of the most popular Czech and Slovak meals. Svíčková is the Czech word for tenderloin, and this dish is traditionally beef tenderloin prepared with vegetables (carrots, parsley root, celeriac and onion), spiced with black pepper, allspice, bay leaf and thyme, and boiled with double cream, though in practice other cuts of beef may sometimes be used, especially falešná svíčková ('false tenderloin') which is a cut from the front shoulder equivalent to jumeau à bifteck in French, or girello di spalla in Italian, cuisine. It is generally served with houskové knedlíky (bread dumplings).
