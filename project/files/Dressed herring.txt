Dressed herring, colloquially known as herring under a fur coat or furry herring (Russian: "сельдь под шубой", tr. "sel'd pod shuboy" or "селёдка под шубой", "selyodka pod shuboy"), is a layered salad composed of diced pickled herring covered with layers of grated boiled eggs, vegetables (potatoes, carrots, beetroots), chopped onions, and mayonnaise. Some variations of this dish include a layer of fresh grated apple while some do not.

A final layer of grated boiled beetroot covered with mayonnaise is what gives the salad its characteristic rich purple color. Dressed herring salad is often decorated with grated boiled eggs (whites, yolks, or both).

Dressed herring salad is popular in Russia, Belarus (Belarusian: Селядзец пад футрам, romanized: Sieliadziec pad futram) and other countries such as Lithuania and Latvia, (Lithuanian: Silkė pataluose, Latvian: Siļķe kažokā). It is especially popular for holidays, and is commonly served as a "zakuska" at New Year (Novy God) and Christmas celebrations in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan.
