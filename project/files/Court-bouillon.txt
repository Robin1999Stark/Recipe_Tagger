Court-bouillon or court bouillon (in Louisiana, pronounced coo-bee-yon) is a quickly-cooked broth used for poaching other foods, most commonly fish or seafood. It is also sometimes used for poaching vegetables, eggs, sweetbreads, cockscombs, and delicate meats. It includes seasonings and salt but lacks animal gelatin.
