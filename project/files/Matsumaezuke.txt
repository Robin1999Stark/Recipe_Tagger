Matsumaezuke (松前漬け) is a pickled dish of dried squid and kelp, native to the Matsumae area of Hokkaidō, Japan.

It is made from fresh ingredients of Hokkaidō. Surume (dried squid) and konbu are wiped with wet cloth and then cut into thin strips with scissors. Kazunoko (herring roe) are chopped into small bits, and carrot and ginger are julienned. These ingredients are then mixed with a boiled mixture of sake, soy sauce and mirin. Several slices of red pepper may be added. The mixture is stored in a cool location for a week before eating.
