Ćevapi (Cyrillic: ћевапи, pronounced [tɕeʋǎːpi]), ćevapčići (formal: diminutive; Cyrillic: ћевапчићи, pronounced [tɕeʋǎptʃitɕi]) is a grilled dish of minced meat found traditionally in the countries of southeast Europe (the Balkans). It is considered a national dish of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, with Bosnia and Herzegovina taking steps in branding and placing them on the entity and a state list of intangible heritage, with a nomination for inclusion on the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage under way. The ćevap is also common in Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Slovenia.

They are usually served in groups of five to ten pieces on a plate or in a flatbread (lepinja or somun), often with chopped onions, kajmak, ajvar (optional), and salt.

Bosnian ćevapi are made from two types of minced beef meat, hand-mixed and formed with a funnel, while Serbian ćevapčići are made of beef, lamb or pork, or a mixture.
