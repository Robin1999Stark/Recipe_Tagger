Rose hip soup (Swedish: nyponsoppa) is a Swedish soup made from rose hips. It is served as a beverage or as a dessert with milk, cream or vanilla ice cream along with small almond biscuits.

Rose hip soup may be eaten for breakfast. The types of soup for that purpose are generally lower in fruit content and more watery, and may be served with pieces of crisp bread.
