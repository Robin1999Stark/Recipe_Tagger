Kransekage (Danish) or kransekake (Norwegian) is a traditional Danish and Norwegian confection, often eaten on special occasions in Scandinavia. In English, the name means wreath cake. In Norway it is alternatively referred to as tårnkake (English: tower cake) and often prepared for Constitution Day celebrations, Christmas, weddings, and baptisms. In Denmark it is typically eaten as part of New Year celebrations, while a variation of the cake, overflødighedshorn, is traditionally served at weddings and baptisms.

The origin of the Kransekage can be traced to the 18th century, where it was first created by a baker in Copenhagen.
