A Buccellato [buttʃelˈlaːto] is a Sicilian circular cake made from pastry dough filled with figs and nuts. It is traditionally associated with Christmas in Sicily.

It is not to be confused with the distinct, but similar traditional Lucchese cake of the same name, the buccellato (di Lucca), although both are ring-shaped sweet breads that contain candied fruit peels.
