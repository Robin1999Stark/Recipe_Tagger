Cock-a-leekie soup is a Scottish soup dish consisting of leeks and peppered chicken stock, often thickened with rice, or sometimes barley. The original recipe added prunes during cooking, and traditionalists still garnish with a julienne of prunes.

While it is called "Scotland's National Soup", it probably originated as a chicken and onion soup in France. By the late 16th century, it had made its way to Scotland, where the onions were replaced with leeks. The first recipe was printed in 1598, though the name "cock-a-leekie" did not come into use until the 18th century.

Traditionally, it is made with broiler fowl. These have very little flesh. Traditionally, the soup will not be loaded with vegetables nor thickeners. It would range from a clear stock to a green leek stock, with little flesh. The rich, chicken, vegetable and thickener versions seen today are produced largely because original cock a leekie is delicate, refreshing and difficult to make delicious. It is not the appetizing meal suggested by the modern version which is closer to chicken soup or stew.

Cock a leekie soup, like a chicken and leek consommé with a little flesh, and pieces of leek, is a traditional soup course at Burns’ Suppers.

There are vegetarian versions of this soup. The vegetarian version has leeks and may include mixed vegetables, chicken flavoured meat substitute and/or prunes.
