Kogel mogel (Yiddish: גאָגל-מאָגל gogl-mogl; Polish: kogel-mogel; Norwegian: eggedosis; German: Zuckerei; Russian: гоголь-моголь gogol-mogol) is an egg-based homemade dessert once popular in parts of Europe. It is made from egg yolks, sugar, and flavourings such as honey, vanilla, cocoa or rum, similar to eggnog or zabaione. In its classic form it is served slightly chilled or at room temperature. Served warm or hot, it is considered a home remedy for sore throats. Variations include milk, honey and soda.
