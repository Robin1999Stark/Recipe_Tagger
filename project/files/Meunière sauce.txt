Meunière (UK: /ˌmɜːniˈɛər/, US: /ˌmʌn-/, French: [mønjɛʁ]; lit. 'miller's wife') is both a French sauce and a method of preparation, primarily for fish, consisting of brown butter, chopped parsley, and lemon. The name suggests a simple rustic nature, i.e. that to cook something à la meunière was originally to cook it by first dredging it in flour.
