A patty or burger (in British English) is a flattened, usually round, serving of ground meat and/or legumes, grains, vegetables, or meat alternatives. Patties are found in multiple cuisines throughout the world.

In British and American English, minced meat that is formed into a disc is called a burger, whether it is in a bread roll or not. The word "patty" is also used in American English but almost unknown in British English.

The ingredients are compacted and shaped, usually cooked, and served in various ways.
