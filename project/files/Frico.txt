Frico (in original Friulian language fricò) is a traditional dish of Friuli, a region in northeast Italy, consisting mainly of heated cheese and, optionally, other ingredients, such as potatoes. Originally frico was prepared in the impoverished region as a way of recycling cheese rinds. There are two popular versions of the dish: one soft and thick, which is usually served in slices, and the other thin and crunchy, which can be used either as a garnish or as an appetizer. While the soft version has a long tradition, the history of the thin version is disputed.

The first recipes for frico date to around 1450 by Maestro Martino, cook of the camerlengo of the Aquileia patriarch. Frico has similarities to another Alpine dish, rösti.
