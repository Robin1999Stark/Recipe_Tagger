Dashi (出汁, だし) is a family of stocks used in Japanese cuisine. Dashi forms the base for miso soup, clear broth soup, noodle broth soup, and many simmering liquids to accentuate the savory flavor known as umami.[1] Dashi is also mixed into the flour base of some grilled foods like okonomiyaki and takoyaki.
