Tequeño is a fried breaded cheese stick or a spear of bread dough with queso blanco (fresh cheese) stuffed in the middle, and is a popular meal or snack in Venezuela. To prepare it, the dough is wrapped around a cheesestick and formed into a breadstick so it can be fried in oil or sometimes oven-baked. Tequeños can be eaten for breakfast, as a side appetizer, or as a snack food at parties and weddings. On April 21, 2023, it was declared a cultural heritage of Venezuela.

The snack is named after Los Teques after being invented in the kitchen of one of the wealthy families living there.
