Chitterlings (/ˈtʃɪt(ə)lɪŋz/), sometimes spelled chitlins or chittlins, are the small intestines of domestic animals. They are usually made from pigs' intestines. They may also be filled with a forcemeat to make sausage. Intestine from other animals, such as beef, lamb, goose, and goat is also used for making chitterling.
