Fish amok or amok trei (Khmer: អាម៉ុកត្រី [ʔaːmok trəj]) is a Khmer steamed fish curry (amok) with a mousse-like consistency, considered one of Cambodia's national dishes. Fish amok is believed to have been a royal Khmer dish dating back to the Khmer Empire, although some question it originating in Cambodia.
