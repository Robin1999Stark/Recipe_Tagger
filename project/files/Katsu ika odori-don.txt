Katsu ika odori-don (活いか踊り丼, dancing squid rice bowl) is a Japanese dish consisting of a fresh squid atop either rice or noodles. Upon pouring soy sauce on the squid, it squirms ("dances") as the muscles react to the sodium in the sauce, in a similar manner to how frog legs twitch when being seasoned. The dish is commonly served with salmon eggs and other toppings.
