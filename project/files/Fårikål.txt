Fårikål (Norwegian pronunciation: [ˈfòːrɪkɔɫ, ˈfɔ̀rːɪkɔɫ]) is a traditional Norwegian dish, and the country's national dish. It consists of pieces of mutton with bone, cabbage, whole black pepper and occasionally a little wheat flour, cooked for several hours in a casserole, traditionally served with potatoes boiled in their skins. The dish is typically prepared in early autumn, and over 70 % of the Norwegian population reports eating the dish at least once during this time period.

Fårikål Feast Day is celebrated on the last Thursday in September each year.
