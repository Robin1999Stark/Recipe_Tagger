Oladyi (Russian: оладьи pl., diminutive: оладушки, oladushki, sg. оладья, oladya, Ukrainian: оладки, oladky) are small thick pancakes or fritters common in Russian and Ukrainian cuisines. The batter for oladyi is made from wheat or (nowadays more rarely) buckwheat flour, eggs, milk, salt, and sugar with yeast or baking soda. The batter may also contain kefir, soured milk or yoghurt. Oladyi may also include various additions, such as apple or raisins.

Oladyi are usually served with smetana (sour cream), as well as with sweet toppings such as jam, powidl, honey etc. Savoury versions may be served with caviar, similarly to blini.

Generally, the term oladki in Eastern Slavic cuisines may also denote fritters made with other ingredients, e.g. potato pancakes (картофельные оладьи), carrot fritters (морковные оладьи), bean pancakes (оладьи из бобовых), rice pancakes (рисовые оладьи), summer squash fritters (кабачковые оладьи) etc. Syrniki (tvorog pancakes) may also be considered a type of oladyi.
