A popover is a light roll made from an egg batter similar to that of Yorkshire pudding, typically baked in muffin tins or dedicated popover pans, which have straight-walled sides rather than angled.

Popovers may be served either as a sweet, topped with fruit and whipped cream; or, butter and jam for breakfast; or, with afternoon tea; or, with meats at lunch and dinner.
