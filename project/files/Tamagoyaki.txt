Tamagoyaki (卵焼き or 玉子焼き, literally 'grilled egg') is a type of Japanese omelette made by rolling together several layers of fried beaten eggs. It is often prepared in a rectangular omelette pan called a makiyakinabe or tamagoyakiki. The word "tamago" means egg in Japanese, and the word "yaki" means to be cooked over direct heat.
