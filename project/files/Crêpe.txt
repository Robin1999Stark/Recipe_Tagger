A crêpe or crepe (/kreɪp/ or /krɛp/, French: [kʁɛp], Quebec French: [kʁaɪ̯p]) is a very thin type of pancake. Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: sweet crêpes (crêpes sucrées) or savoury galettes (crêpes salées). They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as cheese, fruit, vegetables, meats, and a variety of spreads. Crêpes can also be flambéed, such as in crêpes Suzette.
