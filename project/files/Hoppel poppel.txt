Hoppel poppel is an egg casserole made with leftovers, a dish associated with frugal housewives.

Found in German and Austrian cuisine, the casserole dish is also associated with the Midwestern United States. The basic recipe for the casserole is home fries (fried potatoes), scrambled eggs, and onion. Sometimes it is topped with melted cheese. Other ingredients like green pepper or mushrooms can be added to the basic combination, and a variety of meats can be used including bacon, ham and salami.
