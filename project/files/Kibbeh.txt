Kibbeh (/ˈkɪbi/, also kubba and other spellings; Arabic: كبة, romanized: kibba), İçli köfte in Türkiye, Koupes in Cyprus, is a family of dishes based on spiced ground meat, onions, and grain, popular in many countries of West Asia.

In Levantine cuisine, kibbeh is usually made by pounding bulgur wheat together with meat into a fine paste and forming it into balls with toasted pine nuts and spices. It may also be layered and cooked on a tray, deep-fried, grilled, or served raw. In Mesopotamian cuisine, versions with rice or farina are found. Some recipes add semolina.

Kibbeh is considered to be a national dish of Lebanon and Syria, and is a popular dish in the Levant. Versions are found in Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Iraq, the Persian Gulf, Armenia, and Turkey, and among Assyrian people. It is also found throughout Latin American countries that received substantial numbers of immigrants from the Levant during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as parts of North America.
